PathFinder :  Personalized Career  and Learning  Roadmaps for CS  Students

# Intoduction
Choosing the right professional field is a common challenge among Computer 
Science students, who often lack clear guidance on which area best matches their mix 
of technical and soft skills. Many students struggle to find direction between domains 
such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Software Development, and UI/UX 
Design. 

This project aims to develop an intelligent, integrated AI framework that not only 
predicts the most suitable career track for undergraduate Computer Science students 
but also provides tailored courses and learning resource recommendations to 
bridge the identified skill gaps. Using machine learning and natural language 
processing (NLP), the system will generate accurate career predictions and equip each 
student with a personalized and actionable learning roadmap. 

# Motivation
The main motivation behind this project is to help Computer Science students make 
informed career decisions early in their studies. Many students complete their degrees 
without understanding which specialization suits them best, leading to confusion and 
wasted effort. 

This uncertainty is often compounded by a lack of awareness of the requisite skills 
for specific roles and the vast array of available, high-quality learning resources 
(such as free online courses on platforms like Coursera, edX, etc.). This project offers 
a data-driven, personalized approach to guide students toward their ideal field, 
improving their learning efficiency, employability, and confidence before graduation. 

# Objective
Build a machine learning–based prediction model to classify students ● 
into suitable career tracks. 

Identify the six main career fields relevant to Computer Science ● 
students (AI, Data Science, Development, Security, Software Engineering, 
UI/UX).

Design an assessment framework that evaluates academic, technical, ● 
and soft skills. 

Generate personalized career roadmaps with learning ● 
recommendations and resources. 

Develop a user-friendly web interface for input and visualization of ● 
predictions. 

Evaluate the system’s accuracy using the Career Dataset and real student ● 
feedback. 

# Work Plan
Data Preparation: Collect, clean, and preprocess the dataset (skills and career 
labels). 

Feature Engineering: Apply NLP to convert skill text into meaningful numeric 
features. 

Model Training: Test and compare multiple models (SVM, MLP, LSTM, Logistic 
Regression). 

System Design: Develop a prediction platform with a clean and interactive 
interface. 

Roadmap Generation: Create customized learning paths for each predicted field. 

Evaluation: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using test data. 

Deployment: Pilot the system for student use within Ain Shams University.
